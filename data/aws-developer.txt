				□ Error 504 - gateway timeout
		○ Route 53 (DNS Service) - map domain name to EC2 instances, Load Balancers or S3 buckets
		○ AWS CLI
			§ Access key is only available at the time off creation. If you lose it you need to create it again
			§ Pagination, time out error may happen if result is too many. Adjust it using --page-size or --max-items

				□ Includes all udnerlying storage, snposhot, logs and read replicas
				□ To encrypt an existing RDS instance, use snapshot and create an encrypted snapshot and use that to restore a new RDS
			§ RDS Proxy
				□ Sits between application and RDS database
				□ Pools and shares database connections to assist with application scalability and database efficiency
				□ Serverless and scales automatically
				□ Preserves application connection during failover
				□ Detects failover and routes request to stand-by
				□ Can be deployed to multiple AZ

					® That open/close database connections infrequently
					® That require availability through transient failures
					® With open but idle connections
